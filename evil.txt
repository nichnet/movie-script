##FADE IN
#I RICK'S GARAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty are in the garage, surrounded by various gadgets and inventions.
@MORTY "Rick, I have a crazy idea."
@RICK "What is it, Morty? We don't have time for your childish whims."
@MORTY "What if we fill a suitcase with butter and try to bring it on a plane?"
@RICK "(laughs) Morty, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Why would we do that?"
@MORTY "I don't know, it just seems like a fun challenge."
@RICK "(sighs) Fine, Morty. If you really want to do this, I have an idea. Follow me."
Rick leads Morty to a secret room in the garage, where he unveils a machine that can compress any material to a fraction of its original size.
@RICK "This machine can compress the butter so much that we can fit hundreds of kilos in a small suitcase."
@MORTY "Wow, that's amazing, Rick. But won't it be dangerous to bring that much butter on a plan"
@RICK "Morty, when have we ever cared about safety? Besides, we'll just bribe the TSA agents with some of the butter."
@MORTY "(nervous) I don't know, Rick. This seems like a bad idea."
@RICK "Shut up, Morty. We're doing this."
##Cut to
#I AIRPORT - DAY
Rick and Morty are at the airport, carrying a suspiciously heavy suitcase.
@TSA AGENT "Sir, your bag is overweight. You'll have to pay an extra fee."
@RICK "(smirks) How about we make a deal? We have a lot of high-quality butter here. How about you let us through, and we'll give you some of it?"
@TSA AGENT "(intrigued) Butter, you say? Let me take a look."
The TSA agent opens the suitcase, revealing a massive amount of compressed butter.
@TSA AGENT "(amazed) Holy cow, that's a lot of butter. Alright, you can go through. Just don't tell anyone about this."
Rick and Morty walk away, carrying the suitcase of butter.
@MORTY "(relieved) Wow, Rick, I can't believe we got away with that."
@RICK "(smiling) Of course we did, Morty. I'm the smartest man in the universe."
Suddenly, the suitcase starts to shake and emit a strange noise.
@MORTY "Rick, what's happening?"
@RICK "(alarmed) Oh no, I think the compression machine was faulty. The butter is expanding!"
The suitcase bursts open, and a massive wave of butter floods the airport, causing chaos and destruction.
@MORTY "(frustrated) Rick, I told you this was a bad idea!"
@RICK "(defensive) Shut up, Morty. It was worth it for the butter."
#FADE OUT
THE END.
